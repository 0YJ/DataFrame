        It inputs the contents of a text file into itself (i.e. DataFrame). Currently two formats (i.e. csv, json) are supported specified by the iof parameter.<BR>
        The csv file format must be:<BR>
<PRE>
INDEX:<Number of data points>:<Comma delimited list of values>
&lt;Column1 name&gt;:&lt;Number of data points&gt;:&lt;Column1 type&gt;:&lt;Comma delimited list of values&gt;
&lt;Column2 name&gt;:&lt;Number of data points&gt;:&lt;Column2 type&gt;:&lt;Comma delimited list of values&gt;
.
.
.
</PRE>
        All empty lines or lines starting with # will be skipped.<BR>
<BR>
        The JSON file format looks like this:<BR>
<PRE>
{
    "INDEX":{"N":3,"T":"ulong","D":[123450,123451,123452]},
    "col_3":{"N":3,"T":"double","D":[15.2,16.34,17.764]},
    "col_4":{"N":3,"T":"int","D":[22,23,24]},
    "col_str":{"N":3,"T":"string","D":["11","22","33"]},
    "col_2":{"N":3,"T":"double","D":[8,9.001,10]},
    "col_1":{"N":3,"T":"double","D":[1,2,3.456]}
}
</PRE>
        Please note DataFrame json does not follow json spec 100%. In json, there is no particular order in dictionary fields. But in DataFrame json:
        <OL>
          <LI>Column “INDEX” must be the first column</LI>
          <LI>Fields in column dictionaries must be in N, T, D order</LI>
        </OL>
      </td>
      <td>
        <B>file_name</B>: Complete path to the file<BR>
        <B>iof</B>: Specifies the I/O format. The default is CSV
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr bgcolor="lightgrey">
      <td bgcolor="maroon" width = "33.3%"> <font color="white">
        std::future&lt;bool&gt;<BR>
        read_async(const char *file_name, io_format iof = io_format::csv); </font>
