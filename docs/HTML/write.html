        It outputs the content of DataFrame into the stream o. Currently two formats (i.e. csv, json) are supported specified by the iof parameter.<BR>
        The csv file format must be:<BR>
        <PRE>
  INDEX:&lt;Number of data points&gt;:&lt;Comma delimited list of values&gt;
  &lt;Column1 name&gt;:&lt;Number of data points&gt;:&lt;Column1 type&gt;:&lt;Comma delimited list of values&gt;
  &lt;Column2 name&gt;:&lt;Number of data points&gt;:&lt;Column2 type&gt;:&lt;Comma delimited list of values&gt;
      .
      .
      .
        </PRE>
        All empty lines or lines starting with # will be skipped.<BR>
 
        The JSON file format looks like this:<BR>
        <PRE>
          {
            "INDEX":{"N":3,"T":"ulong","D":[123450,123451,123452]},
            "col_3":{"N":3,"T":"double","D":[15.2,16.34,17.764]},
            "col_4":{"N":3,"T":"int","D":[22,23,24]},
            "col_str":{"N":3,"T":"string","D":["11","22","33"]},
            "col_2":{"N":3,"T":"double","D":[8,9.001,10]},
            "col_1":{"N":3,"T":"double","D":[1,2,3.456]}
          }
        </PRE>
        Please note DataFrame json does not follow json spec 100%. In json, there is no particular order in dictionary fields. But in DataFrame json:<BR>
        <OL>
          <LI>Column “INDEX” must be the first column</LI>
          <LI>Fields in column dictionaries must be in N, T, D order</LI>
        </OL>
      </td>
      <td>
        <B>S</B>: Output stream type<BR>
        <B>Ts</B>: The list of types for all columns. A type should be specified only once.<BR>
        <B>o</B>: Reference to an streamable object (e.g. cout)<BR>
        <B>values_only</B>: If true, the name and type of each column is not written<BR>
        <B>iof</B>: Specifies the I/O format. The default is CSV
