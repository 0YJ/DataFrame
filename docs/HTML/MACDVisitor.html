        This is a “single action visitor”, meaning it is passed the whole data vector in one call and you must use the single_action_visit() interface.<BR>
        This functor class calculates the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence oscillator (MACD) which is one of the simplest and most effective momentum indicators available. It could be used to generate signals within financial applications.<BR>
        The constructor takes:<BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>Number of periods for the short-term exponential moving average.</LI>
          <LI>Number of periods for the long-term exponential moving average. (short-term EMA – long-term EMA) = MACD Line</LI>
          <LI>Number of periods for the signal line. EMA(MACD Line) = Signal Line</LI>
          <LI>Decay type for the exponential moving averages.</LI>
          <LI>Decay value for the exponential moving averages (See DataFrame Types and Exponential Roll Adopter).</LI>
        </UL>
        <PRE>
        MACDVisitor(size_type short_mean_period,  // e.g. 12-day
                    size_type long_mean_period,   // e.g. 26-day
                    size_type signal_line_period, // e.g.  9-day
                    exponential_decay_spec ed_spec = exponential_decay_spec::span,

        There are 3 methods that give you the results:
          <LI>const result_type &amp;get_macd_line() const – Returns vector of MACD Line (See above).</LI>
          <LI>const result_type &amp;get_signal_line() const – Returns vector of Signal Line (See above).</LI>
          <LI>const result_type &amp;get_macd_histogram() const – Returns vector of MACD Histogram. (MACD Line – Signal Line) = MACD Histogram</LI>
</OL>
