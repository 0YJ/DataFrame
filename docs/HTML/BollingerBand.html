        This is a “single action visitor”, meaning it is passed the whole data vector in
        one call and you must use the single_action_visit() interface.<BR>
        This functor class calculates Bollinger bands and generates the spread between
        the given column and lower/upper bands. It could be used to generate signals within financial applications.<BR>
        The constructor takes:<BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>Upper band multiplier to be multiplied by standard-deviation and added to the moving average</LI>
          <LI>Lower band multiplier to be multiplied by standard-deviation and subtracted from the moving average</LI>
          <LI>Number of periods for a simple moving mean and std.</LI>
          <LI>Biased; whether the moving std is biased. The default is false meaning the denominator is “n – 1”.</LI>
        </UL>
        <PRE>
            BollingerBand(double upper_band_multiplier,
                          double lower_band_multiplier,

                          bool biased = false)
        </PRE>
        There are 2 methods that give you the results:<BR>
        <OL>
          <LI>const result_type &amp;get_upper_band_to_raw() const – Returns a vector of upper band minus data column.</LI>
          <LI>const result_type &amp;get_raw_to_lower_band() const – Returns a vector of data column minus lower band.</LI>
        </OL>
