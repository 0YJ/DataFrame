        This is a “single action visitor”, meaning it is passed the whole data vector in one call and you must use the single_action_visit() interface.<BR>
        This functor class calculates the crossover of a data vector with two of its moving averages. It could be used to generate signals within financial applications.<BR>
        The constructor takes the two adopters:<BR>
        <PRE>
        DoubleCrossOver(S_RT &&short_moving, L_RT &&long_moving)
        </PRE>
        There are 3 methods that give you the results:<BR>
        <OL>
          <LI>const result_type &get_raw_to_short_term() const – Returns a vector of data column minus short moving average</LI>
          <LI>const result_type &get_raw_to_long_term() const – Returns a vector of data column minus long moving average</LI>
          <LI>const result_type &get_short_term_to_long_term () const – Returns a vector of short term moving average minus long moving average</LI>
        </OL>

        <B>S_RT</B>: A short term moving average adopter. For example, a simple moving adopter using a geometric mean<BR>
