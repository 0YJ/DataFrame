        It bucketizes the data and index into bucket_interval's, based on index values and calls the
        functor for each bucket. The result of each bucket will be stored in a new DataFrame with
        same shape and returned. Every data bucket is guaranteed to be as wide as bucket_interval.
        This mean some data items at the end may not be included in the new bucketized DataFrame.
        The index of each bucket will be the last index in the original DataFrame that is less than
        bucket_interval away from the previous bucket<BR>
        <B>NOTE</b>: The DataFrame must already be sorted by index.

        <B>Ts</B>: The list of types for all columns. A type should be specified only once.<BR>
        <B>bucket_interval</B>: Bucket interval is in the index's single value unit.
        For example, if index is in minutes, bucket_interval will be in
        the unit of minutes and so on.<BR>

        This is exactly the same as bucketize() above. The only difference is it stores the result
        in itself and returns void. So, after the return the original data is lost and replaced with bucketized data
