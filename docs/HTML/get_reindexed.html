        It creates and returns a new DataFrame which has the col_to_be_index column as the index. If old_index_name is not null, it will be loaded as a regular column in the result under the name old_index_name.<BR>
        <B>NOTE</B>: If the new index column is shorter than other columns, every column will be cut to that length.<BR>

        This is similar to get_reindexed(), but it returns a view. Please read above for specs.<BR>

        <B>Note</B>: Although this is a const method, it returns a view. So, the data could still be modified through the returned view
