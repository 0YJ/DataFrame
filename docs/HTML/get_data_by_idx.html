        It returns a DataFrame (including the index and data columns) containing the data from index begin to index end. This function assumes the DataFrame is consistent and sorted by index. The behavior is undefined otherwise.

        It returns a DataFrame (including the index and data columns) containing the data corresponding to the indices specified in "values" vector.<BR>
        This method runs in O(n), where n is the number of indices, by creating a hash table of values. IndexType must be hash able.<BR>
