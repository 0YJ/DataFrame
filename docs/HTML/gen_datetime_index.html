        This static method generates a date/time-based index vector that could be fed
        directly to one of the load methods. Depending on the specified frequency,
        it generates specific timestamps (see below).<BR>
        It returns a vector of I timestamps.<BR>
        Currently I could be any built-in numeric type or DateTime<BR>
        <B>NOTE</b>: It is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure I type
        is big enough to contain the frequency.
      </td>
      <td>
        <B>start_datetime, end_datetime</B>: They are the start/end date/times of requested timestamps.<BR>
        They must be in the following format:<BR>
        MM/DD/YYYY [HH[:MM[:SS[.MMM]]]]<BR>
        <B>t_freq</B>: Specifies the timestamp frequency. Depending on the frequency,
        and I type specific timestamps are generated as follows:<BR>
        <UL>
          <LI>I type of DateTime always generates timestamps of DateTime.</LI>
          <LI>Annual, monthly, weekly, and daily frequencies generates YYYYMMDD timestamps.</LI>
          <LI>Hourly, minutely, and secondly frequencies generates epoch timestamps (64 bit).</LI>
          <LI>Millisecondly frequency generates nano-second since epoch timestamps (128 bit).</LI>
        </UL>
        <B>increment</B>: Increment in the units of the frequency<BR>
        <B>tz</B>: Time-zone of generated timestamps
