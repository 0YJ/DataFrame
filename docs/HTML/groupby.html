        Groupby copies the DataFrame into a temp DataFrame and sorts the temp df by gb_col_name before performing groupby. If gb_col_name is null, it groups by index.

        <B>T</B>: type of the groupby column. In case of index, it is type of index<BR>
        <B>Ts</B>: List of the types of all data columns. A type should be specified in the list only once.<BR>
