        This is a “single action visitor”, meaning it is passed the whole data vector
        in one call and you must use the single_action_visit() interface.<BR>

        This functor produces a Boolean vector of same length as the given column. Each element in the result vector is true if the corresponding element in the column passes the factorization function, otherwise it is false.<BR>

        The constructor takes one parameter which is the factorization function<BR>
