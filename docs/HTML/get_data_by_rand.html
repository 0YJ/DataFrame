        It returns a DataFrame (including the index and data columns) containing the data from uniform random selection. random_policy determines the behavior of method.<BR>
        <B>NOTE</B>: The actual number of rows returned might be smaller than requested. That is because the random process might produce the same number more than once.<BR>
        <B>NOTE</B>: The columns in the result are not padded with NaN.

        It behaves like get_data_by_rand(), but it returns a DataFrameView. A view is a DataFrame that is a reference to the original DataFrame. So if you modify anything in the view the original DataFrame will also be modified.<BR>
        <B>NOTE</B>: There are certain operations that you cannot do with a view. For example, you cannot add/delete columns, etc.<BR>
        <B>NOTE</B>: The columns in the result are not padded with NaN.<BR>
        <B>NOTE</B>: Although this is a const method, it returns a view. So, the data could still be modified through the returned view<BR>
