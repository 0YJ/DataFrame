# Installing using CMake
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

# Uninstalling
 Installing via cmake by default does not **UNINSTALL** target by default. But installed files are
 logged written into `install_manifest.txt` which will be generated by cmake during installation in
 the build directory. So to uninstalling can be done by `xargs rm < install_manifest.txt` from the
 build directory.
