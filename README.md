# DataFrame
This is a C++ statistical library that provides an interface similar to Pandas package in Python.<BR>
You could do almost everything you could do with Pandas within the C++ syntax and type checking framework. You can add/delete any data column type, slice, run summarization functors, transpose, etc. like Pandas. But I also added something that Pandas doesnâ€™t have; <B>Views</B>. You can slice the data frame and instead of getting another data frame you can opt to get a view. A view is a data frame that is a reference to a slice of the original data frame. So if you change the data in the view the corresponding data in the original data frame will also be changed.<BR>
